# Face-Mask-Detection-Project
This repository contains a simple yet effective deep learning model for face mask detection. The model is trained on a dataset of images featuring individuals with and without masks. Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, this AI model accurately identifies whether a person in an input image is wearing a face mask or not.
